# Ansible Variables Deep Dive

## Overview

In Ansible, variables play a crucial role in customizing playbooks, making them flexible and applicable across different environments. This deep dive will explore the concept of variables in Ansible, how to define them, and their usage within playbooks.

## Understanding Ansible Variables

Variables in Ansible are used to store information that varies across different hosts, environments, or scenarios. They provide a way to make playbooks dynamic and reusable. Variables can be defined within playbooks, in separate files, or even passed as command-line arguments.

## Defining Variables in Playbooks

### Inline Variables

In a playbook, you can define variables using the `vars` directive. For example:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    region:
      - ap-south-1
      - us-east-1

  tasks:
    - name: Ansible List Variable Example
      debug:
        msg: "{{ region[1] }}"
```

### External Variables

Variables can also be defined in separate files, often organized in a directory called `vars` or `group_vars`. For example, create a file named `vars/main.yml`:

```yaml
# vars/main.yml
region: [ap-south-1, us-east-1]
```

And reference it in the playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - vars/main.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Ansible List Variable Example
      debug:
        msg: "{{ region[1] }}"
```

## Variable Precedence

Ansible follows a specific order of precedence when it comes to variables:

1. Variables defined in the playbook itself (`vars` directive).
2. Variables defined in included files (`vars_files` directive).
3. Variables defined in inventory.
4. Variables defined as command-line arguments.

This precedence order allows for flexible customization of variables based on the specific needs of each playbook run.

## Example: Jenkins Installation Playbook

Let's take an example of a playbook for installing Jenkins, where we use variables for better customization:

```yaml
- hosts: target
  become: yes
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become_user: root
  vars:
    jenkins_repo_url: https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
    jenkins_key_url: https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
    java_package: java-11-openjdk-devel

  tasks:
    - name: Download Jenkins repository file
      get_url:
        url: "{{ jenkins_repo_url }}"
        dest: /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo

    - name: Import Jenkins key from URL
      ansible.builtin.rpm_key:
        state: present
        key: "{{ jenkins_key_url }}"

    - name: Yum update
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest

    - name: Install Java
      yum:
        name: "{{ java_package }}"
        state: present

    - name: Install Jenkins
      yum:
        name: jenkins
        state: latest

    - name: Daemon-reload to pick up config changes
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        daemon_reload: yes

    - name: Start Jenkins
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: jenkins
        state: started
```

In this example, we use variables to store URLs, package names, and other details, allowing for easy customization without modifying the main playbook.
